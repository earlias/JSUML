        Magic: The Gathering (MTG) is a collectible trading card game that was created by Richard Garfield. It was
        released in 1993 through Wizards of the Coast, the same company that released Dungeons and Dragons. Magic, for
        short, is played with two or more players across a variety of different formats that include different pools of
        the over twenty-thousand cards currently in circulation. There are various different types of cards, such as
        creatures, sorceries, and enchantments, that are all referred to as "spells." Players take turns casting spells
        at each other or onto a board, in order to win, typically by reducing their opponent(s) to 0 life points. The
        different types of cards come across 5 different colors; blue (U), green (G), white (W), black (B), and red (R).
